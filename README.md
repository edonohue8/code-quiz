# JavaScript Code Quiz

## Project Description

My assignment was to create a timed JavaScript fundamentals quiz with specific criteria.  This included a start button to begin the timed quiz, a series of questions, a time penalty for answering a question incorrectly, and saving score information after the quiz is completed.  

### My Process/Steps

My first step was to set-up the HTML page.  I displayed a welcome message and buttons to start the quiz, as well as view the scoreboard.

Next, I worked on the JavaScript file.  I started by creating variables to connect functionality for the buttons on the HTML page.  Next, I created a series of questions with multiple choice selections.  Afterwards, I created functions to make answering each question responsive.  This included keeping score and programming the time counter to decrease by 10 seconds if a question is to be answered incorrectly.

Setting up the scoreboard functionality was next.  At the end of the quiz, the user would see how many questions were answered correctly.  There is then a field to enter the user's initials, that would be saved unto the scoreboard.

Lastly, I added styling to the quiz.  This included making the quiz responsive to mobile device screens, adding styling to buttons, as well as universal styling such as font.
